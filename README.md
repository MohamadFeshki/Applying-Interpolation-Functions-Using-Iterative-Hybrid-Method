# Applying-Interpolation-Functions-Using-Iterative-Methods
Applying the proposed methods in the source paper for interpolation by iterative methods

variables are defined based on the source article.
The methods are applied in two scenarios, without noise, and with noise consideration. Methods are:
1- Hybrid method 
2-Accelerated hybrid method:
3-Iterated method
